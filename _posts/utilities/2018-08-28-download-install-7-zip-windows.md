## What is 7-Zip?



## Step #1: Download

Head over to the [7-Zip home page](https://www.7-zip.org/){:target="_blank"}.

At the top of the page, you can find the installers for Windows.

[Check your windows bit version]({{ site.url }}/windows-10-bit-version-check.html) and click on the corresponding link.

In this guide, we will download the `64-bit x64` version.

Double-click it to run the installer.

On Windows 10 a pop-up window will appear: `The app you're trying to install isn't a verified app from the Store`

Click on `Install anyway`.

The installer will open.

You can change the installation location by clicking on the `…` button.

In this example, we keep the default install location of `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\`.
