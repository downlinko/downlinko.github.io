This is a quick guide on how to download and install [Atom](https://atom.io/){:target="_blank"} on Windows.

Youâ€™ll love the clear **step-by-step approach** in this tutorial.

Ready?

## What is Atom?

[Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor)){:target="_blank"} is an **open source text editor** that works on different operating systems. It contains features like auto-completion and code navigation.

The team behind [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} develops and maintains Atom.

## Step #1: Download

Head over to the [Atom latest release page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest){:target="_blank"} on GitHub.

[Check your windows bit version]({{ site.url }}/windows-10-bit-version-check.html) and click on the corresponding link under the `Assets` section:

* For 32-bit = <kbd>AtomSetup.exe</kbd>
* For 64-bit = <kbd>AtomSetup-x64.exe</kbd>

In this guide, we will download the `64-bit` version.

At the time of writing the latest stable Atom release was version: `1.30.0`.

Open the location of the downloaded executable.

Double-click it to run the installer.

On Windows 10 a pop-up window will appear: `The app you're trying to install isn't a verified app from the Store`

Click on `Install anyway`.

The setup program will install Atom, add the `atom` and `apm` commands to your Windows `PATH` variable. It will also create shortcuts on your desktop and in the start menu.

Once the installation is complete, Atom will launch.

## Step #3: Run

To start Atom double-click on the desktop shortcut.
