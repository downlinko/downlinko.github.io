This is a complete guide on how to download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/){:target="_blank"} on Windows.

(Step-by-step)

We’ve got a lot to cover, so let’s get started.

## What is Android Studio?

[Android Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Studio){:target="_blank"} is an integrated development environment (IDE). It provides tools for building apps on every type of Android device.

Android Studio works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Step #1: Download

Head over to the [Android Studio downloads release page](https://developer.android.com/studio/#downloads){:target="_blank"}.

[Check your windows bit version]({{ site.url }}/windows-10-bit-version-check.html) and click on the corresponding link:

* For 32-bit = <kbd>android-studio-ide-X.X-windows32.zip</kbd>
* For 64-bit = <kbd>android-studio-ide-X.X-windows.exe</kbd>

> For 64-bit, make sure to choose the `Recommended` version which is an `exe` file.

In this tutorial, we will work with the `64-bit` version.

At the time of writing the latest stable Android Studio release was version: `173.4907809`.

On Windows 10 a pop-up window will appear: `The app you're trying to install isn't a verified app from the Store`

Click on `Install anyway`.
