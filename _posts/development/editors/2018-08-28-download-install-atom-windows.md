This is a quick guide on how to download and install [Atom](https://atom.io/){:target="_blank"} on Windows.

You’ll love the clear **step-by-step approach** in this tutorial.

Ready?

## Step #1: Download

Head over to the [Atom latest release page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest){:target="_blank"} on GitHub.

At the top of the page, you can find the installers for Windows.

[Check your windows bit version]({{ site.url }}/windows-10-bit-version-check.html) and click on the corresponding link.

In this guide, we will download the `64-bit x64` version.

## Step #2: Install

Open the location of the downloaded executable.

Double-click it to run the installer.

On Windows 10 a pop-up window will appear: `The app you're trying to install isn't a verified app from the Store`

Click on `Install anyway`.

The installer will open.

You can change the installation location by clicking on the `…` button.

In this example, we keep the default install location of `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\`.
