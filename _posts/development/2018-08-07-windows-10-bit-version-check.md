Do you want to learn how to check your [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows){:target="_blank"} bit version.

In this guide I'll show you how you can do this.

The best part?

It's really easy to do.

Let’s get started…

## Step #1: What Is the Difference Between 32-Bit and 64-Bit Versions of Windows?

The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to **the way a computer's processor handles information**.

The 64-bit version of Windows has the ability to use more memory in your system.

But here’s the most important part:

> The 64-bit versions of Windows can run 32-bit software. But the 32-bit version of Windows can’t run 64-bit software.

As a general rule: [a 64-bit application might be faster](https://superuser.com/questions/271173/how-important-is-having-64-bit-programs-on-64-bit-os){:target="_blank"}. However, in most cases you will not notice the difference.

What this means is that when you install software on your system.

* Always download 32-bit software when you have a 32-bit Windows
* If available download 64-bit software when you have a 64-bit Windows. Otherwise use the 32-bit version.

## Step #2: What Version of Windows Do I Have?

Click on the Search button. Then type "<kbd>about</kbd>" in the search box and press `ENTER`.

Click on the `About your PC`.

Now look under `System type` to see if you're running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows.

In below example we see we are running a 64-bit version.
