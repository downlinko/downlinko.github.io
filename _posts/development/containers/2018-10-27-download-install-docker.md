Have you ever wondered why there are two versions of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} for Windows?

Iâ€™ve been there.

The good news is that there is a simple check you can perform to know which version to download and install.

Let me explain.

## What is Docker?

[Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)){:target="_blank"} enables software developers to package an application with all the parts it needs. As a result the application will work exactly the same in different IT environments.

You can use Docker to deploy an application in a **software container**. This isolates the application from the operating system on which the container runs.  

Docker containers are lightweight and simple to configure. They are created from **images** that specify their precise contents.

Docker was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc. A software development company based in San Francisco, California, USA.
