Today you’re going to learn how to download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} on Windows.

(FAST)

I’m going to show you where to get the installer. And how to run the setup.

Let’s jump right in…

## Step #1: Download

Head over to the [Visual Studio Code downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads){:target="_blank"}.

There are three Windows installer versions available:
1. **User installer**: Installs in your User folder and does not need Administrator privileges.
2. **System installer**: Installs for all users on the system and needs Administrator privileges.
3. **.zip installer**: a portable version.

> Note that [the User setup is recommended since version 1.26](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_26#_user-setup-for-windows){:target="_blank"}.

[Check your windows bit version]({{ site.url }}/windows-10-bit-version-check.html) and click on the corresponding link.

In this guide we will download the `64 bit User installer`.
